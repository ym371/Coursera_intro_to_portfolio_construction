# Coursera_intro_to_portfolio_construction
## Course information
* **Course title:** Introduction to Portfolio Construction and Analysis with Python
* I attended this course on Coursera in July and August 2020. I found it highly informative and systemmatic. It is about using Python packages (mainly Numpy, pandas and matplotlib) in the setting of portfolio construction. Many important concepts of portfolio management are taught in a very clear way in the lectures. Furthermore, the most valuable part is the lab sessions, where Python is used to test and materilise the concepts learned. I personally enjoy the course very much. However, this course takes me longer to complete than it suggests.

## About this reponsitory
This repository contains the following:
* All notebooks that I follow typing in each lab session.
* Some additional lecture notes.
* The most important thing: a python package that we build along the way, namely *edhec_risk_kit.py*
* (My personal notes are saved in OneNote, so I did not put them here)
